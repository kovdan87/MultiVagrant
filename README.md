# Web hosting with MultiVagrant

With this project, you can set up a webpage hosted on localhost by tomcat, and set up one postgres database as well.

The webserver's root folder is the synced shared folder, and you can modify it's content from the host and guest too.

!!!On linux system, you may have to change in the Vagratnfile the hosts port from 80 to something higher than 1024!!!
